# Update
it can now support the use of several languages based on the player's locale as part of a multilingual server, this feature is not essential and you can delete the French version if you wish. If you want TownyGUI to support only one language, feel free to modify "commands.yml" and "menus.yml" while deleting the other alternative versions of these files.
